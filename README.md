## What are the challenges for?
They could be:
- Short coding exercises, for use in interviews with candidates
- Ways for you to test yourself / test your coding abilities under pressure
- Fun exercises to help you learn React 

&nbsp;
## How do they work / how do I get started?
The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you and each challenge has *create-react-app* as its foundation.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in any of the individual challenge directories to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3000 (CRA default)
- Each challenge has a README with requirements for you to complete

*Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme.*

&nbsp;
## Have you got the solutions?
All the coding challenges have been completed to a high standard. Get an automatic invite to the solutions repository at [solutions.alexgurr.com](https://www.solutions.alexgurr.com).

#### Why are the solutions invite only?
People use these challenges for interviews. By putting the solutions behind a collaboration wall / invite-only repository we can discourage candidates from simply looking up the solutions. We track current / past collaborators, meaning if you want to check if a potential candidate had access / looked at the solutions you can get in touch and find out. 

&nbsp;
## Why does it take so long for updates / new challenges?
I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and everything else that comes in life. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges.
