<!-- WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FOR? -->
<h2 id="What-are-the-challenges-for?"> What are the challenges for?</h2>

They could be:

- Short coding exercises, for use in interviews with candidates
- Ways for you to test yourself / test your coding abilities under pressure
- Fun exercises to help you learn React

&nbsp;

<!-- HOW DO THEY WORK / HOW DO I GET STARTED? -->
<h2 id="How-do-they-work/how-do-I-get-started?"> How do they work / how do I get started?</h2>

The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you and each challenge has _create-react-app_ as its foundation.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in any of the individual challenge directories to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3000 (CRA default)
- Each challenge has a README with requirements for you to complete

_Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme._

&nbsp;

<!-- HAVE YOU GOT THE SOLUTIONS? -->
<h2 id="Have-you-got-the-solutions?"> Have you got the solutions?</h2>

All the coding challenges have been completed to a high standard. Get an automatic invite to the solutions repository at [solutions.alexgurr.com](https://www.solutions.alexgurr.com).

#### Why are the solutions invite only?

People use these challenges for interviews. By putting the solutions behind a collaboration wall / invite-only repository we can discourage candidates from simply looking up the solutions. We track current / past collaborators, meaning if you want to check if a potential candidate had access / looked at the solutions you can get in touch and find out.

&nbsp;

<!-- WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG FOR UPDATES / NEW CHALLENGES? -->
<h2 id="Why-does-it-take-so-long-for-updates/new-challenges?"> Why does it take so long for updates / new challenges?</h2>

I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and everything else that comes in life. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges. Interested in becoming a collaborator or submitting your own challenge? **Reach out below or submit a new challenge!**
